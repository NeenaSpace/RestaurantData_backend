Review Summary:
Came in for a bite to eat at a spot open late enough on a Sunday night.

I ordered the French onion soup and the shepherds pie. The French onion soup was super cheesy in a good way, but it was hard to bite without eating so much of it in one bite. The broth and onions though were not cooked and simmered all the way through, so I‚Äôve had better.

The shepherds pie was solid though I felt like the entire dish could have used more salt to bring out the flavors of the meat and the potatoes.

Pretty good value though! Stopped in for breakfast and was not disappointed. I had the Irish breakfast (first time) and it was delicious! My wife had the eggs Benedict and they were also amazing. The staff were friendly also. The Irish Pub atmosphere really worked for me. I am a pot pie lover, and Connolly's knows how to make a pot pie! The crust was light and flaky, the sauce was creamy, and the chicken was tender. I tasted my kid's fries and burger and had almost wished I ordered that. The loaded nachos were large enough for two and an absolute delight! Our waiter was a gem! The host was very welcoming aswell. Convient 3-4 minute walk from Time Square main strip. Next time I'm in New York, I'll definitely visit again!

Review Summary:
I ate here with my family and the food was amazing. At first I didn‚Äôt think I would like the vodka slice but I have to say it was exquisite. I ate the thing all up. My family for got a margarita slice and they were in love with it. This is a nice spot to take your friends and family for a quick bite. The owner was very kind. There may big have been a lot of seats there but it was the best pizza I have ever had I highly recommend eating here. $7 / slice. These are very generous slices ‚Äîboth in sheer size of the slice and generousness of toppings. All in all, 1 slice is already very filling. I did not need to get two. To me this is a solid NYC deal, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre getting your money‚Äôs worth for $7. It‚Äôs generous, filling, and significantly more delicious than most other comparable casual NYC pizza joints. You‚Äôre getting something special and it‚Äôs only $7. After you try it for the first time, you‚Äôll keep coming back. It‚Äôs so delicious.

**Place was completely teeming with people @ 2am Friday night. WOW. I heard about this place on social media and honestly went here expecting it to be another one of those overhyped places, but boy did they prove me wrong! üòÜ We shared a slice of artichoke pizza and one of the Staten Island pizza, which turned out to be a great choice! The artichoke slice was thick-rimmed, creamy and filling, the Staten Island slice crispy with lots of flavorful tomato sauce and having alternating bites meant double deliciousness because every bite felt like the first bite again üòã We were VERY hungry coming here after 3 hours of training, but one slice p.p. filled us up very well! There was seating outside, which was a bit shabby, but it sufficed. We will definitely be coming here again to try some of the other flavours (crab, or another artichoke one maybe üòç).
